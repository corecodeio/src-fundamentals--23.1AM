# SRC FUNDAMENTALS

This repository is a collection of all source code examples and sessions from live coding demonstrations during the bootcamp. It's designed to be a valuable resource for the developers and tech leads, providing a centralized place to access and learn from.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders and files following a structured approach for better organization and ease of use.

```bash
src-fundamentals/
│
├── README.md
│
├── week_01/
│   ├── day_01/
│   │   ├── session/
│   │   │   ├── src-file01.ext
│   │   │   ├── src-file02.ext
│   │   │
│   │   └── standup/
│   │       ├── src-file01.ext
│   │
│   └── day_02/

```

- You can use any name convention you like for the files just keep a two digits numeric record at the end of each file name, starting from `01` (e.g., 00, 01, ...)
- `.ext`: Will be the extensions of the source codes used in the bootcamp (e.g., .js, .py, .md, ...).
- `week_XX/`: Each week of the bootcamp has a folder named with the format week_XX (e.g., week_01, week_02, etc.).
- `day_YY/`: Each day of the week has a folder named with the format day_YY (e.g., day_01, day_02, etc.).
- `session/`: Each live coding session has a folder named session.
- `standup/`: Each stand up session has a folder named standup.
